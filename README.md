# FileSideload

This module provides functionality to "sideload" files (ingesting files that are already on the server). It will allow users to batch-add many files at once to their repository, rather than uploading the files individually. It also will enable users to circumvent server file size restrictions that limit the capacity of web-form upload.

See the [Omeka S user manual](http://dev.omeka.org/docs/s/user-manual/modules/filesideload/) for user documentation.

## Installation
